Welcome to the Bite Sized C Code documentation!
===============================

Hello! I'm Ai, a random embedded software engineer who loves to learn and share the good things. 

This documentation is used to document what I have learned about Embedded C programming, including basics of ``C language``, ``Embedded C concepts``, ``State Machines``, and ``All other things``.

I hope that this resource is useful for you to gain Embedded C programming skills. 

Thank you for visiting my site!
